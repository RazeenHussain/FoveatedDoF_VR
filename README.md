This is a Unity project implements the Foveated Depth-of-Field effect on VR/AR devices.

To work properly, HTC Vive Pro Eye headset is required.

Controls:
To start the rollercoaster, press the "p" key on the keyboard.
To enable the blurring effect, press the "d" key or the "f" key on the keyboard.
To disbale the blurring effect, press the "u" key on the keyboard.
